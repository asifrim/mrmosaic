Description: Structural mosaic abnormalities are large post-zygotic mutations
    present in a subset of cells and have been implicated in developmental
    disorders. While such mutations are routinely assessed in clinical diagnostics
    using cytogenetic or microarray testing, an adequate method using targeted or
    whole-genome sequencing data is lacking. Here, we present a method to detect
    structural mosaic abnormalities using deviations in allele fraction and read
    coverage from next generation sequencing data.
